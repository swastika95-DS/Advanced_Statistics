Multivariate Statistical techniques are important tools for understanding Analysis of Dependence and Analysis of Interdependence. 
The techniques involved in these projects would help in testing for differences between groups, 
estimating and predicting the impact of an independent variable on a dependent variables, and characterizing the underlying factors, 
given a set of items, that best summarize the data using dimension reduction techniques.
